Cell Hypothesis Rules (detailed)

In PSM cells:
pressure decreases cycle entry from 1.00001e-05 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 1 and Hill power 8.

In Ecto cells:
pressure decreases cycle entry from 1.00001e-05 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 1 and Hill power 8.

In NC cells:
pressure decreases cycle entry from 1.00001e-05 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 1 and Hill power 8.
